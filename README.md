UNC Bootcamp HW Assignment 2 - Bootstrap with CSS

`````
Using Bootstrap and some personal CSS I created a responsive portfolio.  I had to link three html pages together and make them all have responsive elements to be viewed on any screen size.  I used bootstrap's grid to layout the page elements and make it clean looking.  I added some personal CSS to change certain elements that needed more attention.
